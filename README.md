## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Criss Corss"

_Language: Javascript_

### Objectives

 - Your function has an input that is a two dimensional array, containing three arrays with three numbers in each

 - for eg:
    [[1,2,3], 
    [4,5,6], 
    [7,8,9]]

- Add together each kitty corner, i.e., 1 + 9 = 10 and 3 + 7 = 10
 - Return the difference 10 - 10 = 0

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
